imsprog (1.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The path of the chip database file was changed from /etc/imsprog to
    /usr/share/imsprog. When updating with update script or manual editing
    the chip database, now an updated or modified database will be saved in
    the user's home folder (~/.local/share/imsprog).
